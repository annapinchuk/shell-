To run the code simply-
1. make all
2. ./myshell
3. Use the shell as you wish:)

notes:
-For segment 12. For the user to move with arrows between commands he must press enter after each arrow and then an additional enter when he decides to execute the current command.
The pipe history supports the history of 20 commands.

-A text file named examples has been added as well which contatins the command examples that we ran.
